## Interview Trivia

In a text file, there is a single character H.
Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file:
Copy All and Paste.
0-minoperations.py has a method 'minOperations' that calculates
the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n H characters in the file.

```
Some requirements:
If n is impossible to achieve, return 0

Example:

n = 9

H => Copy All => Paste => HH => Paste =>HHH => Copy All => Paste => HHHHHH => Paste => HHHHHHHHH

Number of operations: 6
