## Star Wars API

0-starwars_characters.js is a script that prints all characters of a Star Wars movie:

The first positional argument passed is the Movie ID - example: 3 = 'Return of the Jedi'
Character name are displaced per line in the same order as the 'characters' list in the /films/ endpoint.
I have used the Star wars API and use the request module.
